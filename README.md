# Sampling-Experimentation
I did experimentation on how various machine learning algorithms' performance varies on a given data set with respect to different sampling methods

List of Models I used:

1) Naive Bayes 
2) Support Vector Machine 
3) Random Forest
4) Logistic Regression 
5) Decision Tree Classifier


List of Sampling Techniques I used:

1) Simple Random Sampling
2) Stratified Sampling
3) Cluster Sampling
4) Systematic Sampling
